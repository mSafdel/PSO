# PSO
Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm</br>
This project is developing PSO algorithm by Python language.</br>
project file contained 2 source file: PSO and PSO2. PSO used array and list for implementing particle and swarm, but in PSO2 used dataclass for implementing them.
it is a simple program for find minimum of f(x)=x1^2+x2^2 function. you should change it a bit for other functions!</br>
